It provides a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of the parameter, along with a level of confidence associated with that range. The confidence interval is expressed as a range, such as \"between X and Y,\" and is often associated with a confidence level, such as 95% or 99%.\n",

For example, a 95% confidence interval implies that if we were to take many samples and compute a confidence interval for each sample, we would expect approximately 95% of those intervals to contain the true population parameter.\n",
